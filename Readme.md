A small project in Nodejs exploring Graphql with Apollo-server with Typescript.

This project is simple "Users & Tasks" where we have users and each user has a list of tasks.

MongoDB is used as the database. Have incorporated JWT-based authentication for the APIs.

The server runs on port 4000. The API can be explored on 'http://localhost:4000/graphql'
